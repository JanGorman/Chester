## Experimental: @functionBuilder support

`@functionBuilder` seems like a natural match for this kind of task. There's a separate `GraphQLBuilderTests` test suite that shows the supported cases. In it's basic form you can construct a query like this:

```swift
import Chester

let query = GraphQLQuery {
  From("posts")
  Fields("id", "title")
}
```

Nested queries can be defined in their logical order now:

```swift
let query = GraphQLQuery {
  From("posts")
  Fields("id", "title")
  SubQuery {
    From("comments")
    Fields("body")
    SubQuery {
      From("author")
      Fields("firstname")
    }
  }
}
```

### Known Issues
- Queries with multiple root fields and arguments produce a compiler error (e.g. `'Int' is not convertible to 'Any'`)

## Usage

Chester uses the builder pattern to construct GraphQL queries. In its basic form use it like this:

```swift
import Chester

let query = QueryBuilder()
  .from("posts")
  .with(arguments: Argument(key: "id", value: "20"), Argument(key: "author", value: "Chester"))
  .with(fields: "id", "title", "content")

// For cases with dynamic input, probably best to use a do-catch:

do {
  let queryString = try query.build
} catch {
  // Can specify which errors to catch
}

// Or if you're sure of your query

guard let queryString = try? query.build else { return }
```

You can add subqueries. Add as many as needed. You can nest them as well.

```swift
let commentsQuery = QueryBuilder()
  .from("comments")
  .with(fields: "id", content)
let postsQuery = QueryBuilder()
  .from("posts")
  .with(fields: "id", "title")
  .with(subQuery: commentsQuery)
```

You can search on multiple collections at once

```swift
let search = QueryBuilder()
  .from("search")
  .with(arguments: Argument(key: "text", value: "an"))
  .on("Human", "Droid")
  .with(fields: "name")
  .build()
```

Check the included unit tests for further examples.
